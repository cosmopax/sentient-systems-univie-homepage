# Vision: Cognitive Homeostasis

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Active Research Direction

## Core Thesis
We are moving beyond the "Scaling Hypothesis" towards **Cognitive Homeostasis**. The next generation of sentient systems must possess **epistemic autonomy**—the drive to actively minimize surprise (entropy) via Active Inference.

## Key Pillars

1.  **Epistemic Autonomy:** Agents that seek information, not just minimize loss on static datasets.
2.  **Digital Glia:** Architectures that include regulatory layers (metabolic control) alongside computational layers.
3.  **Active Inference:** Replacing the perception-action loop with a unified free-energy minimization process.

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1:** Theoretical framework and manifesto publication (Complete).
- **Phase 2:** Simulation of "Digital Glia" in small-scale recurrent networks.
- **Phase 3:** Deployment of homeostatic agents in complex digital environments (The Holobiontic Nexus).
