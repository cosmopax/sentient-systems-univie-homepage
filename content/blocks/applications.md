# Applications

Our prototypes inform practical systems where autonomy and accountability must co-exist.

- **Adaptive interfaces:** co-creative tools that learn from users.
- **Autonomous research assistants:** open-ended investigation with guardrails.
- **Civic intelligence systems:** participatory analytics and governance.
- **Robotic ecosystems:** coordinated fleets for environmental monitoring.
