# Sentient Systems Laboratory

We investigate machine consciousness, adaptive cognition, and synthetic perception. Our lab designs systems that learn, reflect, and coordinate across complex environments.

We combine computational neuroscience, embodied AI, and systems engineering to probe the boundary between reactive intelligence and emergent awareness.
