# Research

Our research program explores cognition as a layered system: perception, memory, agency, and ethical control.

- **Neural architectures:** adaptive memory, predictive coding, and self-models.
- **Embodied cognition:** learning through physical and simulated interaction.
- **Collective intelligence:** multi-agent coordination and shared reasoning.
- **Safety and alignment:** verifiable control for autonomous systems.
