# System Modules

We build modular cognitive stacks that can be recombined across research threads.

- **Perception stack:** sensor fusion, attention, and saliency detection.
- **Memory stack:** episodic and semantic storage with retrieval policies.
- **Agency stack:** planning, action selection, and self-critique loops.
- **Ethics layer:** constraint enforcement and oversight protocols.
