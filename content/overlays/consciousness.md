# Artificial Consciousness

We are operationalizing Integrated Information Theory (IIT 4.0) to measure Phi in silicon substrates.

### Approach

- **Substrate Independence**: Testing consciousness on non-neuromorphic hardware.
- **Qualia Modeling**: Mathematical formalization of subjective feeling.
