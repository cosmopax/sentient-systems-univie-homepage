# Biological Co-Processors

**Wetware Intelligence.**

We are integrating living biological neurons with silicon hardware to create hybrid "biological computers." By culturing neurons on microelectrode arrays, we can stimulate and read from the biological network in real-time, leveraging the massive energy efficiency of biological computation for AI tasks.

* **Systems:** FinalSpark, Cortical Labs CL1
* **Metric:** Energy per synaptic operation (< 1 femtojoule)
* **Goal:** AGI via biological substrate.
