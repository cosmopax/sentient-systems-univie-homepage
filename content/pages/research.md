# Research Domains

## Autonomous Agents

Building software entities that operate with high degrees of freedom. Our agents are designed to navigate the open web, gather information, and negotiate with other agents without human intervention.

## Emergent Behavior

Studying how complex patterns arise from simple rules. We run large-scale simulations of "Game of Life" variants to observe the spontaneous generation of logic gates.

## Cyber-Physical Systems

Bridging the digital and the physical. We control robotic swarms using decentralized consensus algorithms derived from blockchain technology.
